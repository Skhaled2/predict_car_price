# predict_car_price
Project Overview

This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features such as car brand, model, year, mileage, engine size, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on these features.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

Brand: The brand of the car (e.g., Toyota, BMW, etc.)
Model: The specific model of the car
Year: The manufacturing year of the car
Mileage: The total distance the car has traveled
Engine Size: The size of the car's engine
Fuel Type: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.)
Transmission: The type of transmission (e.g., Manual, Automatic)
Price: The target variable, representing the price of the car

Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python packages:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter
You can install these packages using pip:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter

Notebook Structure

The notebook is structured as follows:

Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand the data.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data to identify patterns and relationships between features and the target variable.
Model Building: Build and train various machine learning models to predict car prices, including linear regression, decision trees, and more.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.
Conclusion: Summarize the findings and discuss potential improvements for the model.
Running the Notebook

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the notebook file.

Results

The results section of the notebook includes:

Model performance metrics

Visualizations of predicted vs. actual car prices
Insights and conclusions based on the model evaluation
Future Work
Possible future enhancements for this project include:

Incorporating additional features such as car condition, location, and owner history
Experimenting with advanced machine learning techniques and hyperparameter tuning
Deploying the model as a web application for real-time car price prediction
